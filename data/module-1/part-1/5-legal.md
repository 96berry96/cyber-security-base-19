This course will not delve deeply into the law, but note that companies and
corporations have responsibilities and liabilities for the data they gather.
Most have made a commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to treat data
gathered with the utmost care. In addition, laws and regulations govern the way
these entities must secure their data and dictate the correct procedure to
follow after a breach has occurred.

For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU)
[2016/679](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e6226-1-1))
unifies and simplifies the regulations for data protection within the European
Union. The GDPR replaces the current directive in this area, and has as its
main objective in giving people control over their personal data. Furthermore,
the regulation covers matters such as the export of personal data outside of
the EU, sanctions for non-compliant parties, the right to erasure, and data
breach reporting procedure. This regulation is in force as of the 25th of May,
2018.

The GDPR provides the first economical grounds for data protection: just as
environmental regulations have internalized the cost of environmental damage to
production, we may see the same happening with data protection. Insurance
companies have also noticed the impending GDPR and have introduced various
types of cyber security insurance which would cover some costs caused by a
breach (for example a loss of profit).

However, the law is for the law abiding; for a criminal it is just a deterrent.
The Internet provides anonymity and distances the attacker from the victim,
making it easier to step into the world of crime via the Internet. The
commission of crimes via the Internet is commonly known as *hacking*.
(When discussing hacking we do have to mention *ethical hacking*. An
ethical hacker, like his criminal counterpart, is an expert who tries to
penetrate a computer system, but the former does it with permission from the
system owner in order to reveal security vulnerabilities that malicious actors
could potentially exploit.)

This information is provided for educational purposes and not for causing
malicious or damaging attacks. Again, performing any penetration testing
requires permission from the owner of the target. Moreover, it should be noted
that the target may reside on the same server as other services, so permission
from the service provider may also be needed.
