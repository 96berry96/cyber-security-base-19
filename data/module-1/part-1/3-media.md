Security-related news has become more and more common. Media reports about
breaches are no longer minor items buried in miscellaneous news, but instead
are prominent front-page material. Everything, from baby monitors to security
cameras, from cars to luxury yachts, has been targeted and hacked. The threats
news agencies talk about have become more complex and more professional. Stolen
password lists have become sought-after merchandise and news about targeted
ransomware attacks have been seen at an unprecedented rate. This reveals the
grim truth that our lives online, and by extension our lives offline, have
become an easy way for criminals to make money, and that this threat affects
all industries, countries, and social spaces.

Although the media is beginning to take breach news seriously, and studies such
as the [Crime Survey of England and Wales](http://www.crimesurvey.co.uk/) from
the Office of National Statistics show that the frequency of incidents is
increasing, it is still commonly believed that cyber crime is an underreported
area of illegality.

The above conveys a bleak picture of the current state of things. At the same time, however, governments, organizations, corporations and institutions are funnelling more and more money, research and effort into improving the situation.
