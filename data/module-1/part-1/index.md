ability to disrupt the functionality of a system; corporate responsibilities
and liabilities; and the never-ending software crisis that is related to the
increasing amount of software and maintenance.

This course has only 1 part.

### How to get started


How to get started?
This material contains the introduction part of the course series called "Cyber
Security Base". In order to answer the questionnaires and essays, you will need
a MOOC.fi account that you can create at https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new. Once
you've signed up, you can login to this page (click on the top right corner).

Once you have created the account, please answer a background questionnaire at
https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/74256/lomake.html. Answering the
questionnaire should take less than 10 minutes and will be very valuable for
the research conducted on this course.

When answering the short essay questions in this course, please answer them
carefully and with thought. Other participants in the course will review them
and may give you feedback.

### How to pass the course

In order to pass the course you will need to return all the essays and give at
least 3 peer reviews for each essay. Also, you will need to pass all the
multiple choice questions.

Essays must be within 20% of the proposed length. If they're not within this
limit you will not get any points for your answer. We also may reject your
answer if it's flagged too many times as spam or if it doesn't contain deep
enough discussion. Also, we may reject your peer reviews if you haven't put
genuine effort into them.

If you want ECTS credits you will need to register here AFTER completing the
course: https://cyber-points.mooc.fi
