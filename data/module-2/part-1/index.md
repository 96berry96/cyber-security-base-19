<text-box variant=emph name='On Securing Software'>


This material contains the securing software part of the course series called [Cyber Security Base with F-Secure](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/). During this course, you will learn how web software works and is developed, the types of typical security flaws in such software,
the vulnerabilities that these flaws cause, and how these flaws can be
fixed.

By continuing, you agree to not to do any harm with this information or other similar information on the internet.

The first set in this course starts with a gentle introduction to how network applications can be communicated with, and how basic web applications work. Further content will be added weekly, and will delve deeper into the security issues.

In order to answer the questionnaires and essays, you will need a MOOC.fi account that you can create at [https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new](https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new). The same account that you did for the introduction part works here as well. Once you've signed up, you can login to this page (click on the top right corner).

Please also answer a questionnaire on self-regulated online learning at [https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/74563/lomake.html](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/74563/lomake.html). The questionnaire is different to the one in the introduction part of this course series. Answering the questionnaire should take less than 10 minutes and will be helpful for the research conducted on this course.
