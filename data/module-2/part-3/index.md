This part focuses on security issues related to interconnected software. The
participant will learn the principles of developing web applications, typical
security issues that are related to such applications, and how such issues are
discovered and mitigated.

<please-login></please-login>

The course consists of 6 parts.

### How to get started

This material contains the securing software part of the course series called
[Cyber Security Base](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/). During this course,
you will learn how web software works and is developed, the types of typical
security flaws in such software, the vulnerabilities that these flaws cause,
and how these flaws can be fixed.

Once you have created the account, please answer a background questionnaire at
https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/74256/lomake.html. Answering the
questionnaire should take less than 10 minutes and will be very valuable for
the research conducted on this course.

When answering the short essay questions in this course, please answer them
carefully and with thought. Other participants in the course will review them
and may give you feedback.

### How to pass the course

Essays must be within 20% of the proposed length. If they're not within this
limit you will not get any points for your answer. We also may reject your
answer if it's flagged too many times as spam or if it doesn't contain deep
enough discussion. Also, we may reject your peer reviews if you haven't put
genuine effort into them.

To pass the course you need to get 130 points (max 152 points).  Each passed
essay or completed programming exercise is equivalent to 5 points, and each
passed multiple choice question is equivalent to 1 point.

By continuing, you agree to not to do any harm with this information or other similar information on the internet.

The first set in this course starts with a gentle introduction to how network applications can be communicated with, and how basic web applications work. Further content will be added weekly, and will delve deeper into the security issues.

In order to answer the questionnaires and essays, you will need a MOOC.fi account that you can create at [https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new](https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new). The same account that you did for the introduction part works here as well. Once you've signed up, you can login to this page (click on the top right corner).

Please also answer a questionnaire on self-regulated online learning at [https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/74563/lomake.html](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/74563/lomake.html). The questionnaire is different to the one in the introduction part of this course series. Answering the questionnaire should take less than 10 minutes and will be helpful for the research conducted on this course.
