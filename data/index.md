Cyber Security Base is a free course series by University of Helsinki and MOOC.fi in collaboration with F-Secure that focuses on building core knowledge and abilities related to the work of a cyber security professional.

Learn about tools used to analyse flaws in software systems, necessary knowledge to build secure software systems (esp. within Web), the skills needed to perform risk and threat analysis on existing systems and the relevant legislation within EU.

The course series consists of 6 smaller courses, each with a specific theme. Themes include a brief introduction to cyber security, operational security, web software development, types of vulnerabilities typical of web software, discovery and mitigation of such vulnerabilities, and advanced topics such as secure software architectures and cryptography. There will be several case studies as well as projects for participants. At the end of the course series, we'll also organize a friendly capture-the-flag competition where participants will try to solve some security puzzles.

Each course is open for a certain period of time, and must be completed during that window.

# Work load and prerequisites

There will be programming assignments, essays, quizzes and puzzles throughout the courses, and completing a specific part of a course means working and completing most if not all of them. We expect that individuals work some 2-10 hours per week on the courses depending on their background. Some programming background and ICT experience is required.

The course has started! You don't need to register to start doing the course. There is an optional registration for those who want ECTS credits that can be done AFTER completing the course. More instructions in the material. So just head to the material and start doing the courses!

# ECTS credits for Finnish residents

If you reside in Finland, you can get a total of 10 ECTS credits for the course from the Open University of University of Helsinki. Your own school, college or university has the option of accepting these as a part of your studies -- you have to, however, ask your local administration whether they will do so. We are looking into the possibility of offering certificates for completion of the course series to all participants as well.
